#### About Flowchart Image Captioning

This project aims to caption or translate flowcharts into their respective pseudocode.

As a guide, I used this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-captioning-with-keras-teaching-computers-to-describe-pictures-c88a46a311b8).

This project still holds lots of room for improvement. Some of the main ones are:
1. Image Captioning with an Attention Mechanism
2. More pseudocode/flowchart data. Until now I only fed 37 flowcharts with 37 pseudocode translations into the model.
3. Use a Domain Specific Language instead of pseudocode for easier translation.

### Run Jupyter notebooks
Run jupyter notebook in the terminal.
Open the `inspect_image_caption_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebooks to view results within the code.
